# dot

This is a personal dotfiles management system that I've been using and fucking around with for many years. It
started as a set of bash scripts called "setupthebomb.sh" and "allyourbase.sh" that were used to bootstrap
development environments on remote development servers. Over time, it evolved into...whatever this is!

> [!WARNING]
> This project bootstraps _my personal development environment_ and is highly customized to my specific
workflows, preferences, and machine configurations. It is almost certainly not suitable for anyone else to
use directly. You are welcome to review the code, patterns, and configuration approaches for inspiration or
educational purposes. However, I won't make any promises about this working for anyone else. **Running the
install script can and will modify your existing configuration files!**
